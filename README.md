How to use
===========

From your Google Drive, you can create a Script or a SpreadSheet. Then you have to setup the TV Shows you are watching.

You will receive an email with the torrents of yours TV shows depending on the scheduled time of the script.

How to set up
--------------

*	Create a SpreadSheet or a Script from your Google Drive

	- If you created a SpreadSheet you have to go to Script Editor menu

*	Copy the code of the [script](https://raw.github.com/davidayalas/gas-torrent-emailer/master/gas-torrent-emailer.js)

* 	Go to **File > Project Properties**, and in the pop up window, select **User properties** and add a list with your TV Shows. The format has to be "tv show sXXeXX" where "s" is the season and "e" the current episode to download. Sample "Dexter s07e01"

*	Schedule a time to execute the search of torrents. Go to **Resources > Current script's triggers** and schedule the "main" function a number of hours: 6 or 12 is right.
